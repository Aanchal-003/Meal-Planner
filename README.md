## Recipe management and planning web application

This web application can be used to create and manage recipes that you like. Both recipes that exist on the internet already and recipes made by yourself. Then the saved recipes can be used to plan out meals for the week. As of right now each day can only hold a single meal. From the chosen meals an easy grocery list can be created by selecting missing ingredients from the a recipe. Of course, groceries can also be manually added to the grocery list. Last but not least, the grocery list tab allows to categorize groceries to make it easier to find them at the store. So categorize meat products in a meat category and a the store you can pick out all the meats right away.
